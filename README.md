This example demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where the catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other route matches. The problem occurs when a request should match a specific route but is unexpectedly caught by the wildcard route, resulting in an incorrect component being rendered.  The solution illustrates how to correctly configure routes to prioritize specific path matches over the catch-all route.
